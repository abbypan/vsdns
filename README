    Description
DNS made simple.

    Overview
VSDNS is FOSS: legal info is in the 'LICENSE' file.
It is written in ANSI C for UNIX-like environment (Linux, OS X, ...).
NewbieDNS is a module, not a library, so it is intended to be changed
as you wish and included directly into code of your project.

    Compiling
Compilation is described in Makefile, however it is mostly about flags,
since the thing is so simple.  Type 'make' to produce working example.

    Example
The example prints response for A record from 1.1.1.1 DNS server for
veresov.pro domain in human-readable form (so the response is parsed).

    Usage
The module presents response in dns_answers, which is a linked list.
Function dns_get request given server about given domain name for
given record type (dns_type_*) and returns parsed response.
You can step through it to process all answers, each answer has
some way of accessing its fields.
Don't forget to free memory after use with dns_free.

    Motivation
DNS deserves understandable implementation.
